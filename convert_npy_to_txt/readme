Instructions for reconstructing Figures 3 and 5 given the files in this folder

The sigma_#_arr.txt arrays have dimension (num_R, num_trials). num_R = 21, and num_trials = 30.
The scalar value at (i, j) or (row, col) in the array is the log10(MSE_between_convolved_prediction_and_convolved_truth).
That MSE value should be the y-axis value when plotting.

Each index of i in the sigma_#_arr.txt files corresponds to the same index of i in log10(R_values).txt.
The values of log10(R), found in log10(R_values).txt, should be the x-axis value. There are 21 numbers along the x-axis.

Pseudocode to reconstruct Figures 3 and 5 in paper draft:
for each j in range(0,30):
    For each i in range(0,21):
        plot(x=loaded_log10_R[i], y=loaded_log10(MSE_between_conv......)[i][j])
